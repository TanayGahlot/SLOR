#SLOR:Saving Life On Road
In majority of cases death in road accident are caused due to trajectory, condition and location as oppose to behavior of driver. We took the accident dateset from Goa government on road accident and suggest optimal deployment of RTO Officer and ambulance by creating a predictive model and visualization as heat map over Ponda city map. Our system was able to produce optimal deployment of ambulances based on accident hotspots. A rough prototype is available on http://slor.in
